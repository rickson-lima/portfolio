        I'm Rickson, I work as a software engineer from Amazonas, Brazil. I
        specialize in building web applications and sites using Javascript,
        React & Node. I've procrastinated building this website for years but
        finally it's here. I expect to fill it along the time with my
        experiences, projects, ideas & thoughts (mostly about tech).{" "}

      <p className="text-gray-300">
        As a professional, I enjoy to solve real world challenges and build
        complex applications because these are the best opportunities to improve
        my skills and learn how to impact other ones with my ideas. Over these 4
        years working as developer, I've been learning a lot about myself as
        well and discovered that resilience is a key factor in my mindset.

        As person, sometimes I just want to chill, play with friends and
        practice my piano â™ª
